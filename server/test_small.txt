The purpose of this guide is to give you the brewer all the
information you need to strike off into unknown territory, and to help
you become the ultimate brewing god. In it, I will try to communicate
my brewing philosophy and techniques. In short, I will teach you the
summation of everything I know about brewing and life!
Zymurgy (pronounced Zi-mer-gee, with the i pronounced like 'eye') is

the study of living, organic chemistry. It seeks to use and manipulate
chemical compounds (such as salts and sugars), living organisms
(yeast), and a universal solvent (water!) to create a pleasant
tasting, psychoactive substance called alcohol. Alcohol is a drug,
similar to many other drugs that every culture known to man has used
to expand the consciousness, commune with the gods, or just to catch a
buzz. Alcohol in general, and beer in particular, may have been the
driving force behind the eventual civilizing of the beast, man. After
all, without fermentables, there is no alcohol, and without
cultivation, and therefore civilization, there are precious few
fermentables. Some societies come by their alcohol requirements the
hard way, doing all kinds of mean, nasty, stupid things to make it. In
modern times, and with modern methods, you and I can drink like kings,
if not like gods.
